# Laravel Multi Tenancy

The term "multi-tenancy" refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and 
serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance.
With a multi-tenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of 
the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties.
